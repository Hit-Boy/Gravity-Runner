PullToLane - snap to lane (constant moving towards the Lane + snapping)
RotateToGravity - rotate to targetRotation (Quaternion rotate towards)
FindDesiredLane - find new desiredLane based on location 
CheckJumpAvailability - check if floor is under


pullAvailability = false;
rotateAvailability = false;
jumpAvailability
desiredLane = middle;

CheckAllInput - function that checks all incoming input and also stores it so it can be performed in quick succession
will call all functions from here	

3 options: moveLane, switchGravity, jump 

moveLane(available if pullAvailability = false && rotateAvailability = false): 
pullAvailability = true;
desiredLane = left or right;
enact pull to desiredLane;
player should be able to enact this function during previous one so on the screen it will be performed in quick succession;
invert commands then on the left side or on the ceiling;
Consists of functions:
PullToLane

switchGravity(available if pullAvailability = false && rotateAvailability = false):
nulify speed;
change gravityDirection;
pullAvailability = true;
target rotation = gravityDirection;
find different desiredLane;
enact rotation towards target rotation;
enact pull to desiredLane;
player should be able to enact this function during previous one so on the screen it will be performed in quick succession
Consists of functions: 
CheckStoredInput - check if second change should be performed
CheckInput + StoreInput to perform 2 in a row
NulifySpeed
RotateToGravity and PullToLane should be executed in same exact time (max pullTime = rotate time)

Jump(available if pullAvailability = false && rotateAvailability = false && jumpAvailability = true)
just jump;
create bigger horizontal hitbox that allows player to jump a bit later
